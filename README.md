# computer_architecture-an-instruction-simulator
In this assignment, you will implement an instruction-level simulator for a single cycle MIPS processor in C++ step by step.
The simulator supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set and can model the execution of each instruction.

steps to use codes:
> make


> ./MIPS
